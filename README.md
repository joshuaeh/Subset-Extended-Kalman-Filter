# Subset Extended Kalman Filter

Updating Neural Network models as changes in the underlying system occur:

- slowly and monotonically (drift)
- discretely (transfer learning)

## Installation

The `sekf` package can be installed using `pip` (though it is not yet on the pip namespace) two ways:

- `pip install git+https://github.com/joshuaeh/Subset-Extended-Kalman-Filter.git` to install from the github repository
- clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/joshuaeh/Subset-Extended-Kalman-Filter.git`, then install locally using `pip install -e <path_to_repo>`

## TODO

- pypi distribution for `pip install sekf` [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
- documentation
