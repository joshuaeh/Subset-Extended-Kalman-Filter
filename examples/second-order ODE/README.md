# Second-Order ODE System

![system 3d plot](bvp.png)

$\epsilon y^{\prime \prime} + y^\prime + y = 0$, $0 \le x \le 1$  
$y(0)=a, y(1)=b$

The second order system described slowly evolves as the parameter $\epsilon$ changes.

## Setup

The system uses the `sekf` package. To install this within the currently-active python environment, run `pip install -e .` from the `Subset Extended Kalman Filter` directory.

## Usage

Within the `second-order ODE` directory, use the `config.json` file for user-provided arguments. These include:

- `RANDOM_SEED`: Seed used for random number generation
- `NOISE_STD`: Standard deviation of measurement noise

Training parameters:

- `TRAINING_EPSILON`: Initial $\epsilon$ value that NN is trained on
- `TRAINING_SAMPLES`: Number of training samples
- `TESTING_SAMPLES`: Number of testing samples
- `TRAINING_EPOCHS`: Number of training epochs
- `TRAINING_MODEL_SAVE_PATH`: Path to save the trained model
- `TRAINING_DATA_SAVE_PATH`: Path to save the training data
- `TRAINING_PLOT_PATH`: Path to save the training plot

Updating parameters:

- `UPDATING_FINAL_EPSILON`: Final $\epsilon$ value
- `UPDATING_N_MEASUREMENTS`: Number of measurements where `\epsilon` changes linearly from `TRAINING_EPSILON` to `UPDATING_FINAL_EPSILON`
- `UPDATING_MODEL_SAVE_PATH`: Path to save the updated model
- `UPDATING_PLANT_DATA_SAVE_PATH`: Path to save plant data
- `UPDATING_MODEL_DATA_SAVE_PATH`: Path to save the model predictions
- `UPDATING_OPTIMIZER_SAVE_PATH`: Path to save the updating optimizer
- `UPDATING_PARAM_SELECTION`: should itself be a JSON object with keys "method" and "param".
  - `method`: The method used to select the parameters. Options are "proportion", "magnitude", or "none".
  - `param`: The parameter used for the method. If "proportion" is selected, this should be a float between 0 and 1. If "magnitude" is selected, this should be a float greater than 0.

The `secondOrderODE.py` file contains many of the function definitions used in the training and updating process. The `run_all.py` file may be used for running the process from start to finish. Otherwise:

1. Run `python train_model.py` to train the model.
2. Run `python update_model.py` to 1) take a measurement of the system and 2) update the model. Running this `UPDATING_N_MEASUREMENTS` times will update the model to the final epsilon value. The model is saved at `UPDATING_MODEL_SAVE_PATH` and the optimizer is saved at `UPDATING_OPTIMIZER_SAVE_PATH`. The updated model is then used to take measurements of the system.

**Note that if the `train_model.py` and `update_model.py` files are run seperately, `secondOrderODE.py` should be modified so that the random number genrerator does not have a seed. If it does, it will always generate the same random walk step.**
